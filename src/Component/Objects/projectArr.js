Also, popular house hunting platforms in Lagos here always leave the communication with the agent to be outside the platform, this makes most house hunters be susceptible to extortion as the condition stated on their platform changes when they chat them up or even give them a call. This also makes reporting and monitoring of the agent's integrity almost impossible for these platforms. How about scammers that pose as agent on these platforms. Most of these users are not verified.",
