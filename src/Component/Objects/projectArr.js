The hustle of searching for numerous apartment with beautiful images online but later discovered that the house is not what they expected it to be. Also, popular house hunting platforms in Lagos here always leave the communication with the agent to be outside the platform, this makes most house hunters be susceptible to extortion as the condition stated on their platform changes when they chat them up or even give them a call. This also makes reporting and monitoring of the agent's integrity almost impossible for these platforms. How about scammers that pose as agent on these platforms. Most of these users are not verified. Below are the proposed solutions integrated into the design of Harbode website.",

This is done by integrating QR payment which is fast and reliable to ensure faster transaction time. The transaction will be forced to be within Smuut acount of the sender to Smuut account of the merchant. This way, customers don't need to wait for 20-infinity minutes just to confirm their transaction in the store as transation is processed in real tssime and alert will be delivered in nano seconds.

Also, i take into consideration to go through user feedbacks on playstore and appstore to further know the challenges and features they enjoyed on these apps.",
